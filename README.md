# What's This?

A simple example of how to create an Web Extension for modern browsers.

This extension will replace (almost) all images on a web page with images of kittens, using the https://placekitten.com web service.

## How do I use it?

Clone or download a zip of this repository then follow the instructions below for your browser to load the extension locally.

More info: https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/package-your-extension/#Windows

**Chromium browsers**

1. Open the Extensions menu
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click on the "Load unpacked" option
4. Select the **src** folder
5. ???
6. Kittens!

**Firefox**

Firefox doesn't allow loading extensions directly from a folder. First you need to create a zip file with the contents of the **src** folder. The zip should contains only the files, not the folder itself.

1. Create a zip file with the contents of the extension
2. Open the Add-ons menu in Firefox
3. In the cog menu, select the option "Debug Add-ons"
4. Click on option "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the zip file
5. ???
6. More Kittens!

This method of loading the extension only keeps it installed until you restart Firefox.
